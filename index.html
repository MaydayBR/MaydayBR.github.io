                    <p>I am a third-year student at MSU majoring in computer science. I love to learn and embrace being a beginner. I'm never afraid to ask for help and believe that there is always more to be learned. I value asking questions and see it as a key part of the learning process. There are always new ideas and perspectives on ways to solve problems. I enjoy challenges and view them as opportunities to grow and learn. I love collaborating with others and learning from their experiences and insights.</p>

                    <h3>Interactive News Article</h3>
                    <p>I delved into web scraping using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, allowing me to extract meaningful content from HTML documents. I explored API integration, particularly with OpenAI's GPT models, which taught me how to harness powerful language models to generate insightful responses. Implementing Flask as a web framework enabled me to create a robust backend for handling requests and serving web pages. I set up environment variable management with dotenv, securing sensitive information such as API keys. Throughout the process, I implemented logging to monitor application behavior and debug effectively. I gained hands-on experience with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves retrieving relevant documents and generating responses based on that information, thereby improving the quality and relevance of generated content. This technique, often implemented using tools like LangChain, significantly enhances the application's ability to provide accurate and contextually appropriate answers.</p>

                    <h3>YouTube Video Analysis</h3>
                    <p>After completing this project, I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience with several new tools and techniques. I learned how to leverage the YouTube Transcript API to fetch video transcripts, which involved understanding how to extract and manipulate video IDs from URLs. This project also enhanced my skills in integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to summarize transcripts and generate responses based on user questions. I improved my Flask application development skills, particularly in managing routes and handling JSON data with the request and jsonify modules. Implementing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) with Flask-CORS was another critical aspect, ensuring my application could interact with resources from different origins. Through this project, I solidified my understanding of web scraping, API integration, and secure application development practices, which collectively broadened my technical expertise.</p>

                    <p>Here is a video of my hackathon project during Michigan Tech Week. I was the team lead for our project and I was the one who created the back end that you are seeing here. My team and I were given 10 days to try and come up with an idea to 'fix' a problem that Michigan is currently facing. The Michigan-based problem that we decided to tackle was the decreasing rates of physical activity in our state. Our idea was to create an easy-to-use and fun social way to create and plan local phycial activities/events. After making a social profile you are able to create or join local events such as a morning jog which your neighbor might have scheduled for 10 am tomorrow. Our final goal is to make it so that you are able to see the other profiles that have joined said event in your area and have a social web where you can see what all of your friends social plans are.</p>
